# Milestone Project - Dueces Wild (Band Page)

### Project Idea
Build a website for a band (real or fictional)

External userâ€™s goal:
The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows.

Site owner's goal:
The band are interested in selling more of their music/merchandise and getting more gigs.

Potential features to include:
Showcase photos, audio and/or video clips from the band's catalog.
Publicise the band's upcoming shows and/or availability to perform at events such as weddings and corporate parties.
Provide links to external resources, such as the band's social media profiles (can point anywhere at all).
