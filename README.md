# Milestone Project - Dueces Wild (Band Page)

### Project Idea

The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows.

The band are interested in selling more of their music/merchandise and getting more gigs.

Potential features to include:
Showcase photos, audio and/or video clips from the band's catalog.
Publicise the band's upcoming shows and/or availability to perform at events such as weddings and corporate parties.
Provide links to external resources, such as the band's social media profiles (can point anywhere at all).
