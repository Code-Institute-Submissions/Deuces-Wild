# Deuces Wild (Band Page)

![multi device website mockup](https://github.com/docmartin87/Deuces-Wild/blob/31228d558e9f1f8410402dc3480715a8c8910873/assets/images/MultiDeviceWebsiteMockup.jpg)

This is website for Deuces Wild’s fans and people who are not yet fans to go to if they want to see where the band are playing over the next few months, if they want buy band merchandise, if they want to learn more about the band and its members and if they want to book the band.

It has clear and concise pages and information with the intention of increasing revenue for the band by highlighting who they are and what they offer.

It is designed to be responsible and accessible on a range of devices.


## UX

The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows.

The sites intention from the band’s perspective is to sell more of their merchandise, get more gigs, and also increase their fan base by highlighting their gig schedule.

It’s a very simple UX idea having a band description and reviews on the home page and then having separate pages for the main pieces of information that someone who is visiting the site would need.

Some user stories I thought of before designing my site;

* As a fan who is interested in seeing the band at their next gig, I can go to the website and easily find that information on the Gigs page.
* As a fan who is interested in booking the band for a gig, I can go to the website and easily find the information on the Home page and even contact the band directly on the Contact page.
* As a person who might be just looking at different bands to play at a party that they are organising, I can easily see from the Home page the description of the band and even see a video of the band in action.
* As a person who wants to buy merchandise for the band, I can go to the website and easily find where to buy band merchandise on the Merch page.

### Design

* Colour Scheme
    * The colour scheme is 3 colours, black, grey and red, to match the colours used in the band’s logo
* Typography
    * The Roboto Font is the font used on the site for Headings with the Exo for descriptions and blocks of text, both with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there is an issue with Google Fonts. I like the combination of both fonts and I think they are easy to read on both a desktop and a mobile screen.
* Imagery
    * The imagery which has been used is important and has been chosen to be eye catching for anyone using the site.
* Wireframes
    * Links to my initial Wireframe design is in the “Wireframe” folder in assets in my repository.


## Features 

Each of the 5 pages has a universal header for the navigation of the site. It is made up of 3 columns. The middle column is the bands logo and links back to the home page. The side columns have 2 buttons in each and link to the other pages on the site.

Each of the 5 pages has a universal footer that leads to the band’s social media pages.

The Home page (index.html) is used to describe what the band do, has 2 customer reviews, and gives contact details on how to book them for a gig. I embeded a video from Youtube of the band. 

The Gigs page is a simple design of splitting the section into 2 columns and using a heading of the Month/Year on the left of the page and a list of Dates and Venues then down the right hand side of the page.

The Merch page took a bit of thinking on my part as the band itself doesn’t actually sell merchandise so I went and looked at The Killers website for inspiration which just had a list of links to the sites that sold their merchandise so I used the same idea but had three separate links. Records linked to HMV, Clothes linked to Pennys, and Memorabilia linked to a memorabilia site.

The Band page is a simple design also of a 4 rows, each split into 2 columns, one for a photo and another for a quick name, instrument, and description of each member.

The Contact page is a form consisting of a name, email and message text input and a button to send the message.

### Existing Features

* Header (on each page) – allows users on each page to navigate the website, by having them select buttons to go to each page on the site.
* Footer (on each page) – allows users on each page to navigate to the bands social media sites which will open on a separate tab.
* Home page (index.html) – allows the users to see the band in action by clicking an embedded video of the band from Youtube.
* Merch page (merch.html) – allows the users to be redirected to sites which open on new tabs where the user can buy band merchandise.
* The Gigs page (gigs.html) – allows the users to see when and where the band are playing in the upcoming months.
* The Band page (band.html) – allows the users to get to know the band members.
* The Contact page (contact.html) – allows the users to contact the band through use of a form.

### Features Left to Implement

* Header (on each page) – I’d like to make this shrink and stick to the top of the window when users scroll down on each page.
* The Contact page (contact.html) – I’d actually like to test this form and get it working to a actual email address.
